DESCRIPTION
This work is an implementation of several algorithms to optimize the traveling sales problem.
Implementations are done in Julia under TravelingSales/ and in CUDA under CUDA/.
The Julia work implements the Gravitational Search Algorithm, and the CUDA work implements [CUDA algorithm here].

DATA
The data used for this project came from TSPLIB at http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/
