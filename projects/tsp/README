Description
This work is an implementation of several algorithms to optimize the traveling sales problem.
Implementations are done in Julia under TravelingSales/ and in CUDA under CUDA/.
The Julia work implements the Gravitational Search Algorithm, and the CUDA work implements [CUDA algorithm here].
