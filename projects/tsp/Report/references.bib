abstract = {In this paper, a branch and bound model with penalty tour building is developed for solving travelling salesman and transportation routing problems. The algorithm for determining the optimal solution of the problem is of the general form which can solve symmetric and asymmetric single and multiple travelling salesman problems (STS and MTS), and the transportation routing problems with capacity restrictions for the vehicles of same or of different capacities. The behavior of the developed algorithm is tested with randomly generated data. As an application, the routes for gas distribution is planned and carried out in several interior towns of a state, with the objective of making an efficient distribution in order to minimize the total cost of delivery with an optimal solution.}

abstract = {In recent years, various heuristic optimization methods have been developed. Many of these methods are inspired by swarm behaviors in nature. In this paper, a new optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions is introduced. In the proposed algorithm, the searcher agents are a collection of masses which interact with each other based on the Newtonian gravity and the laws of motion. The proposed method has been compared with some well-known heuristic search methods. The obtained results confirm the high performance of the proposed method in solving various nonlinear functions.}

 abstract = {An algorithm is described for solving large-scale instances of the Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) to optimality. The core of the algorithm is a "polyhedral" cutting-plane procedure that exploits a subset of the system of linear inequalities defining the convex hull of the incidence vectors of the hamiltonian cycles of a complete graph. The cuts are generated by several identification procedures that have been described in a companion paper. Whenever the cutting-plane procedure does not terminate with an optimal solution the algorithm uses a tree-search strategy that, as opposed to branch-and-bound, keeps on producing cuts after branching. The algorithm has been implemented in FORTRAN. Two different linear programming (LP) packages have been used as the LP solver. The implementation of the algorithm and the interface with one of the LP solvers is described in sufficient detail to permit the replication of our experiments. Computational results are reported with up to 42 STSPs with sizes ranging from 48 to 2,392 nodes. Most of the medium-sized test problems are taken from the literature; all others are large-scale real-world problems. All of the instances considered in this study were solved to optimality by the algorithm in "reasonable" computation times.},

abstract = {This paper explores a dynamic programming approach to the solution of three sequencing problems: a scheduling problem involving arbitrary cost functions, the traveling-salesman problem, and an assembly line balancing problem. Each of the problems is shown to admit of numerical solution through the use of a simple recursion scheme; these recursion schemes also exhibit similarities and contrasts in the structures of the three problems. For large problems, direct solution by means of dynamic programming is not practical, but procedures are given for obtaining good approximate results by solving sequences of smaller derived problems. Experience with a computer program for the solution of traveling-salesman problems is presented.},

abstract = {A “branch and bound” algorithm is presented for solving the traveling salesman problem. The set of all tours (feasible solutions) is broken up into increasingly small subsets by a procedure called branching. For each subset a lower bound on the length of the tours therein is calculated. Eventually, a subset is found that contains a single tour whose length is less than or equal to some lower bound for every tour. The motivation of the branching and the calculation of the lower bounds are based on ideas frequently used in solving assignment problems. Computationally, the algorithm extends the size of problem that can reasonably be solved without using methods special to the particular problem. }
